If you will be testing the functionality of the code on your machine:

* Add appropriate values in backend/config.ts,

* Comment out https server initialization in backend/index.ts, otherwise you'll need to generate your own SSL certificates,

* Change the "serverURL" in frontend/src/webSocketsUtil/ to "https://localhost:<port_specified_in_backend_config.ts>

* Use the restore_backup.sql to initialize the postgre db: 
-- $ create database <some_new_db_name> with owner admin;  <--- if you want to specify a different user, you'll have to change permissions for the restored db, since that one has "admin" as its owner
-- $ psql <some_new_db_name> < restore_backup.sql
